# synthforjam

A 'collective synth' example, design for the course 'Real Time Interaction' (by Sergi Jorda) - Sound and Music Computing Program - Universitat Pompeu Fabra (2017)

Simply download the repository, open main.pd to use the main patch.
To be able to control smartphone, download MRMR application. Open mrmr_patch.pd with puredata along with main.pd. You need to request the design of the smartphone interface personally.
The presets in the package are composed in G-Harmonic Minor. To access other chords, go Control Panel (brown section) -> pd Controller -> pd chords (in the red section).
You can change the bass patterns from the .txt files in the pd_patch folder.
Enjoy!
